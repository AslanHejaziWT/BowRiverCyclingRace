Convincing the CEO for the Cycling Race Application and Event Execution

Introduction:

Peter, the Project Manager responsible for organizing the company's 10th-anniversary cycling race, is preparing to present his plan to the CEO. The event aims to engage employees, promote health and wellness, and enhance team spirit, all while celebrating the company's milestone. Peter's proposal includes deploying a mobile application for tracking the race, strategically placing QR code boards along the race route near Bow River, and implementing a tiered prize distribution for the winners.

Peter’s Presentation to the CEO:

1. Overview of the Cycling Race Event:

"Good morning, Mr. CEO. I am excited to present our proposal for the 10th-anniversary cycling race, which will be a fantastic opportunity to engage our employees, promote wellness, and celebrate our company's success. The event will feature a 20 km race along the scenic Bow River, where participants will scan QR codes at regular intervals to verify their progress. We will award prizes to the top 10 finishers, with significant rewards to encourage participation and competitiveness."

2. Mobile Application for QR Code Scanning and Race Tracking:

App Functionality: We propose developing a dedicated mobile application for the event that will be installed on participants' cell phones. The app will:

Allow participants to register for the race.
Track progress by scanning QR codes placed every 200 meters along the race route.
Record timestamps of each QR code scan, ensuring that participants are following the designated route and are actively participating.
Provide real-time race updates, including ranking and performance analytics.
Ensure secure record-keeping to verify results, thus enhancing the integrity of the competition.
Technical Benefits:

Data Accuracy: The app will precisely track each participant's route and time, providing accurate data to determine the winners.
Scalability: The application can be adapted for future events, such as marathons or other fitness challenges, maximizing our investment.
User Experience: With an intuitive interface, employees can easily navigate the app, making it accessible to all, regardless of their technical skills.
3. Installation of QR Code Boards:

QR Code Boards Installation:

Boards with QR codes will be installed every 200 meters along the 20 km race route. These QR codes serve as check-in points that must be scanned by participants during the race.
This system will discourage shortcuts and ensure that all participants complete the full course as planned.
Technical Implementation:

QR codes will be securely embedded in durable boards designed to withstand outdoor conditions.
Each QR code is unique and can only be scanned once, providing a secure way to track participant progress.
The boards will be strategically placed to guide participants through the entire race, creating a clear path without confusion.
4. Prizes for Top Participants:

Prize Structure:
The top 10 finishers will receive prizes, with the first-place winner receiving $10,000, and prizes gradually declining to $1,000 for the 10th place. This non-linear prize distribution incentivizes competitiveness among participants and acknowledges a wide range of top performers.
Awarding significant prizes will not only motivate employees to participate but also recognize their efforts, reflecting the company’s commitment to rewarding excellence.
